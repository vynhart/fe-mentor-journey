## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flex display to center element vertically

### What I learned

It turns out centering element in CSS is not so easy. I managed to use
a guide from css-tricks by using flex display and flex-direction of column.

### What I'm not sure about

- I'm not sure about the HTML semantic that I should use.
- For the card weight, I take the value from figma file (320px). 
  Is that correct?
- I don't know the correct font-size for the title in the card.
  I just randomly picking the font-size (1.5em for h1) to try to match
  the design as close as possible. What's the correct way of doing this?
